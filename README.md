## Landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) using Machine Learning methods

This part of the code includes the training and verification process of three types of machine learning models (support vector machine, multilayer perceptron, and random forest) , 
it also includes the complete data preprocessing process. The whole process was carried out in the ArcGIS Pro 3.0.0 environment, therefore, when reproducing the code, the compiler 
must use the Python compiler that comes with ArcGIS Pro.
